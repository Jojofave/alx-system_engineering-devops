# Postmortem: Web Application Outage - August 5, 2023

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** August 5, 2023, 09:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The web application experienced intermittent downtime, with users unable to access certain pages and perform essential tasks. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

## Timeline

- **09:00 AM:** The issue was detected by an automated monitoring alert indicating increased server response times.
- **09:15 AM:** Engineering team was alerted about the incident and started investigating.
- **09:30 AM:** Initial investigation showed a spike in database queries and slow API responses.
- **10:00 AM:** Assumption made that a sudden traffic surge caused the issue; scaled up server resources.
- **10:30 AM:** No improvement seen; realized that server resources were not the root cause.
- **11:00 AM:** Incident escalated to backend and database teams for further investigation.
- **11:30 AM:** Root cause identified, and a fix was deployed to restore normal service.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a database query optimization issue, resulting in slow responses and excessive load on the database server.
- **Resolution:** The engineering team optimized the problematic queries and added missing indexes. The database server was restarted to apply the changes.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Improve monitoring: Implement advanced monitoring to detect query performance issues in real-time.
- Load testing: Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks before they impact users.
- Code reviews: Introduce stricter code reviews to catch inefficient queries during development.
- Documentation: Document best practices for query optimization to prevent similar incidents.

## Conclusion

The web application outage was resolved by identifying and optimizing problematic database queries. Moving forward, proactive monitoring, load testing, and improved code review practices will be implemented to prevent similar incidents.
